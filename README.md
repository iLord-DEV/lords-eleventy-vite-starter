If your Version is under 16, please update or install a version manager [like nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

After cloning (or downloading) the repository to your local machine, install all dependencies with the command

```

## Run dev server

The project comes with Eleventyâ€™s built-in development server. You can start the server with

````

## Build

To trigger a production build, use

Sass or PostCSS 

CSS methodology: CUBE CSS (give it a try or use your own) [https://cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi)

[Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) adds necessary browser prefixes. The [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) settings can be adjusted in `package.json`.
